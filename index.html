            <p class="mb-4 editable">It’s crucial that your organization’s constitution keeps pace with these changes. Failing to update your governance framework to reflect modern trends can leave your organization behind, struggling with outdated practices that no longer serve its best interests. Here are some of the key governance trends that should be reflected in your constitution:</p>
            
            <h5 class="text-primary editable">1. Smaller Board Sizes</h5>
            <p class="editable">There is a growing trend towards reducing the size of boards, particularly in not-for-profit organizations. Smaller boards are seen as more agile and effective, allowing for quicker decision-making and more dynamic discussions.</p>
            <p class="editable">Steven Bowman highlighted this issue, noting that “in many organizations, particularly in Australia, the board sizes are between 14 and 16... Makes no sense.” This trend is shifting towards more streamlined boards that can better meet the demands of modern governance.</p>

            <h5 class="text-primary editable">2. Term Limits for Board Members</h5>
            <p class="editable">Implementing term limits for board members is becoming increasingly common. This practice helps to refresh the board with new perspectives and prevents stagnation or entrenchment of long-serving members.</p>

            <h5 class="text-primary editable">3. Use of Technology in Governance</h5>
            <p class="editable">The use of technology in governance has accelerated, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes virtual meetings, digital voting systems, and online collaboration tools, which have become essential for modern boards.</p>
            <p class="editable">Gordon Shaw pointed out the necessity of updating constitutional clauses to reflect these changes, stating, “Ensure that while you are doing your constitutional review, you have adequately reflected what your workflows are in terms of technology for meetings, for resolutions as well.” This shift towards digital governance requires boards to revisit and update their constitutions to accommodate new technological practices.</p>

            <h5 class="text-primary editable">4. Independent or Co-opted Directors</h5>
            <p class="editable">There is a growing recognition of the value of appointing independent or co-opted directors to fill specific skills gaps on the board. This approach allows boards to bring in expertise that may not be available within the organization’s traditional membership.</p>
